            <h1>Guild of Beers</h1>

            <p class="lead">Welcome to the Guild of Beers! Please read the following carefully.</p>

            <section id="rules">
                <h2>Rules</h2>
                <p>We only have four rules here in the guild:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>NAAT raid has a damage cap of 5M per day. This will significantly slow down the pace of the raid and allow everyone to get damage on the board.</li>
                    <li>HRancor raid has a 24 hour zero damage limit. That means NO DAMAGE within the first 24 hours after the raid starts.
                        We can easily finish this raid within an hour or two and since we have guild members all around the world, this gives
                        everyone a chance to get on the board. Even if the raid finishes before you are able to get a hit, you'll still get rewards.
                        It's a win-win. After 24 hours, we ask that you limit the damage to around 1M. First failure to follow this rule will result in a warning.
                        A second offense will result in getting the boot!</li>
                    <li>Have fun and talk with your guildies! Sit back, drink a beer, and enjoy the game.</li>
                    <li>If a player has no game activity for more than 21 days, they will be removed in order to make room for an active player unless the
                        player notifies an officer in advance that they will be inactive and will be coming back (e.g. vacation, planned 
                        hospitalization, etc.). If someone is unexpectedly inactive for more than 21 days and comes back, they can contact us
                        in Discord and we will do what we can to get them back into the Guild.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Troubles Doing Zero Damage?</h3>
                <p>
                    Send in <strong>one</strong> of your weakest characters who does NOT counterattack. You will receive a warning message for sending
                    one toon. You can safely ignore it and try again.
                </p>

                <h2>Communication</h2>
                <p>
                    Lets face it, the built in chat in SWGOH is horrible and can be difficult to organize conversations. For this, we encourge all members
                    to use <a href="https://discordapp.com/">Discord</a>. In order to receive an invite, send an email to
                    <a href="mailto:guildofbeers@gmail.com?subject=Discord%20Invite">guildofbeers@gmail.com</a> with the subject, "Discord Invite".
                    Please be sure to incude your player's name and ally code.</p>

                <p>Troubles finding your ally code?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Launch Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes</li>
                    <li>Tap on your name on the home screen</li>
                    <li>You'll see your ally code in the top left corner under your name (e.g. 123-456-789)</li>
                </ul>
