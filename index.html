            <h1>Guild of Beers</h1>

            <p class="lead">Welcome to the Guild of Beers! Please read the following carefully.</p>

            <section id="rules">
                <h2>Guild Makeup</h2>
                <p>
                    We have guild members from all around the world. It is a challenge to ensure that everyone
                    can participate in the Raids and earn the great rewards. To be fair to everyone, we enforce
                    the following rules.
                </p>

                <h3>Raid Rules</h3>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> These rules change periodically as the guild gets stronger and we adjust.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>HAAT &amp; Sith
                        <ul>
                            <li>There are no time limits or damage caps on the HAAT &amp; Sith raids.  You're welcome to use your powerhouse teams,
								however, we ask that everyone keep in mind that we want everyone to treat the other guildies fairly and not always
								be at the top of the rankings.  We all contribute raid tickets, and we all should reap the rewards.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Heroic Pit (Rancor)
                        <ul>
                            <li>During the first 24 hours after the raid starts, members should enter the raid but do
                                <strong>NO DAMAGE</strong>. (<a href="#no-damage">How to do no damage</a>)</li>
                            <li>After the first 24 hours, members are limited to 1 million damage points.</li>
                            <li>As a matter of courtesy to allow everyone a chance to earn a 7-star Raid Han Solo,
                                the guild members that have him already do minimal or no damage for the entire raid.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Guild Rules</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>First and foremost, have fun! Chat with your guildies! Sit back, drink a beer, and enjoy the game!</li>
                    <li>Join our Discord server. Communications during the Territory Wars and Territory Battles is much
                        easier there than using the in-game chat. (<a href="#communication">How to join</a>)</li>
                    <li>We are a laid back guild, but we all want to make progress toward the greater rewards. We are active
                        in the Territory Battles and Territory Wars. Because success in these requires active guild participation,
                        we have an activity requirement.
                        <ul>
                            <li>If a player has no game activity for more than 7 days, they will be removed in order to make room
                                for an active player.</li>
                            <li>However, we will suspend the automatic removal if a guild member notifies an officer on Discord in
                                advance that they will be inactive and will be coming back (e.g. vacation, planned hospitalization, etc.).</li>
                            <li>If someone is unexpectedly inactive for more than 7 days and comes back, they can <a href="#contact">contact an officer</a> in Discord.
                                We will do what we can to get them back into the Guild. (See below about Discord usage.)</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Sadly, some members have decided that these rules do not apply to them. The officers do not enjoy doing it, but they
                        will enforce them. Anyone not following any of the rules can be kicked from the guild, with or without a warning,
                        at the officer's discretion, depending on the severity and frequency of the infraction(s).
                </ol>

                <h3 id="no-damage">How can you do zero damage?</h3>
                <p>
                    Send in <strong>one</strong> of your weakest characters who does NOT counterattack. You will receive a warning message for sending
                    one toon. You can safely ignore it and try again.
                </p>

                <h2>Communication</h2>
                <p>
                    Lets face it, the built in chat in SWGOH is horrible and can be difficult to organize conversations. For this, we encourge all members
                    to use <a href="https://discordapp.com/">Discord</a>. In order to receive an invite, send an email to
                    <a href="mailto:guildofbeers@gmail.com?subject=Discord%20Invite">guildofbeers@gmail.com</a> with the subject, "Discord Invite".
                    Please be sure to incude your player's name and ally code.</p>

                <h3>Troubles finding your ally code?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Launch Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes</li>
                    <li>Tap on your name on the home screen</li>
                    <li>You'll see your ally code in the top left corner under your name (e.g. 123-456-789)</li>
                </ul>
